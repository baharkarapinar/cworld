        <ul class="Questions">
            <li>Q - Will my plant flower every year?</li>
            <li> A - Once the cacti and succulents are at a flowering age they will flower every year providing 
                that they are looked after properly and kept in the right conditions. 
                Many cacti start flowering when they are 2-3 years old.</li>
            <li> Q - Where do cacti and succulents like to be?</li>
            <li> A - Cacti and succulents like a sunny position, for example a south facing windowsill or a conservatory 
                or greenhouse, where they are protected from frost and excess humidity.</li>
            <li> Q - Can I keep cacti and succulents outside?</li>
            
            <li>A Cacti and succulents are mostly from tropical regions and all of our plants have been raised under glass, so we would not recommend keeping them outside, however, if you live in a warm climate, you may have some success with hardier varieties such as Agaves outside, 
                but it is essential that they are protected from harsh conditions such as frost.</li>
            <li> Q - Do cacti and succulents need watering?</li>
            <li>A Yes! One of the great myths about cacti and succulents is that they don't need water but, 
                whilst they are hardier than some plants, they will still need to be watered from early March until September. 
                They won't need watering in the winter. Most varieties will need one good watering a week, 
                but don't allow them to stand in water, as this will rot the roots.</li>
